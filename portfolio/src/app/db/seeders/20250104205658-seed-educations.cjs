Over the years, I have acquired most of my knowledge of the language through self-directed study, dedicating significant time to independent learning and practice using a variety of resources. This self-taught approach has allowed me to deepen my understanding of English grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. As a result of my continuous effort and practice, I confidently assess my abilities as being at a B2 level according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), which reflects my capability to understand the main ideas of complex texts and to interact with native speakers with a fair degree of fluency and spontaneity.',
